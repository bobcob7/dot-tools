# sudo-context MCP Server

## Purpose

MCP server for structured directory context storage as flat JSON files. Provides machine-readable context that tracks what each directory does, when it was last updated, and whether it's stale.

## Functionality

Provides three tools:
- `upsert_context` — create or update directory context with section merging
- `query_context` — retrieve stored context, optionally filtered by section
- `check_context_status` — audit all directories for missing, stale, or orphaned context

Context is stored under `{project_root}/.sudo-context/` as `context.json` files.
