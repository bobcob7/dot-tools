# skills/plan-loop

## Purpose

Skill for automatically implementing all remaining plans using the ralph-loop plugin. Iterates through plans in dependency order, creating a feature branch and PR for each.

## Functionality

- Verifies preconditions (clean repo, plans/.context.md exists)
- Starts a ralph-loop that implements plans one by one
- Each iteration: finds next eligible plan, implements it, marks complete, creates PR
- Terminates when all plans are done or max iterations reached
