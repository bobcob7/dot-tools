Explain the code at `$ARGUMENTS` in clear, accessible language.

## Guidelines

1. **Start with the big picture**
   - What is the overall purpose of this code?
   - Where does it fit in the larger system?

2. **Break down the logic**
   - Walk through the code step by step
   - Explain non-obvious algorithms or patterns
   - Note any clever tricks or idioms

3. **Highlight key concepts**
   - Design patterns used
   - Important data structures
   - External dependencies and their roles

4. **Call out gotchas**
   - Edge cases handled (or not)
   - Assumptions made
   - Potential pitfalls

## Output Format

```
## Overview
[1-2 sentence summary]

## How It Works
[Step-by-step explanation]

## Key Details
- [Important point 1]
- [Important point 2]

## Related Code
- [References to related files/functions if relevant]
```

Adjust depth based on code complexity. Simple utilities need brief explanations; complex algorithms need more detail.
