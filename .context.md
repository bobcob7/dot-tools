# dot-tools

## Purpose

Personal dotfiles and configuration tools repository. Provides automated setup scripts for development environments across macOS and Linux (Ubuntu/WSL).

## Functionality

- Modular setup system for installing and configuring development tools
- Cross-platform support (macOS and Ubuntu/Linux)
- Idempotent installation (safe to run multiple times)
- Consistent theming with Dracula color scheme across tools
- Custom MCP servers for extending Claude Code

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `setup.sh` | Main entry point that orchestrates module installation |
| `sync.sh` | Diff and import tool — compares installed configs against repo, imports changes back |
| `README.md` | Project documentation and usage instructions |

## MCP Servers

Custom MCP servers are stored in `configs/claude/mcp/`. During setup, these are automatically:

1. Copied to `~/.claude/mcp/`
2. Registered with Claude Code via `claude mcp add`

To add a new MCP server:
1. Create a directory under `configs/claude/mcp/<name>/`
2. Add `main.py` implementing the MCP protocol
3. Run `./setup.sh claude` to install
